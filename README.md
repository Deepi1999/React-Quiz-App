I developed a dynamic Quiz App using React.js that allows users to take quizzes on various topics. The app features an intuitive, responsive user interface, where users can select a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and receive real-time feedback on their answers. Key functionalities include:

Dynamic Question Rendering: Questions and options are fetched dynamically and rendered based on user selection.
State Management: I utilized Reactâ€™s state management to track user progress, store answers, and calculate scores at the end of the quiz.
Interactive UI: Real-time feedback is given on correct and incorrect answers, with final scores displayed at the end of each quiz.
Clean Design: A clean and user-friendly interface for easy navigation through the quiz.
This project helped solidify my skills in React.js, component structure, state handling, and managing user interactions efficiently.
